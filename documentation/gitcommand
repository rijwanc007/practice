If you only require the names of the changed files
-> git show --name-only <commit-hash>

displays the commit history of a Git repository
-> git log

if the branch you want to delete has been fully merged
into another branch,use -d (safe delete) option
->git branch -d <branch-to-delete>

if the branch has unmerged changes and you want to delete
it anyway(use with caution , as this can lead to data loss),
use the -D (force delete)option
->git branch -D <branch-to-delete>

if you want to create a new branch but remain on your current
branch,use
->git branch <new-branch-name>

new branch will exist,but you will still be on your original
branch.to switch to the newly created branch,you would then use
->git checkout <new-branch-name>
or
->git switch <new-branch-name>
