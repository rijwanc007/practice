Water fall method

Requirement elication / gathering -> feasibility study -> analysis -> design -> coding -> testing -> deployment -> maintenance

--> Single pass development to 6 to 18 months

--> All the requirement are predicted initially

--> Phase wise handover

--> Testing is done towards the end

--> Customer involvement after the completion of the process

--> Changing requirements are not entertained

--> No working software event in the late process , it comes with lots of surprise

Agile(flexibility)

--> The agile is a software development methodology is which is one of the simplest and effective process to 
	turn a vision for a business into a software solution.
	
--> Agile is term used to describe software development approach the employ continual planning , learning ,
	improvement , team collaboration , evolutionary development and early delivery.
	
--> Instead of single pass deployment of 6 to 18 months , agile adopts a process of frequent feedback where
	a workable product is delivered after 2 to 4 weeks iteration

--> It encourages a flexible responses to change.
	
Agile values

--> (Individual and interaction over process and tools) : valuing people more highly than process and tools
	because it is ultimately the people who respond to business needs and drive the development process
	
--> (Working software over comprehensive documentation) : agile does not eliminate the documentation agile
    documents requirements as users story which is sufficient for a developer to begin work on a particular 
    task. 	
	
--> (Customer collaboration over contract negotiation) : Periodic demo -> feedback -> early delivery at a 
    small interval of time -> ensuring business needs of the customer.
    client -> before the start of process / after the completion of process.  

--> (Responding to changes over following a plan) :	In agile changing requirements are welcomed in even
	late development phase.
	continual plan -> continual learning -> continual improvement -> evolutionary development -> responding changes
	
Agile manifesto

--> Highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software

--> Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. agile processes harness change for the customer's
	competitive advantage.
	
--> Deliver working software frequently,from a couple of weeks to a couple of months,with a preference to the
	shorter timescale.

--> Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project

--> Build projects around motivated individuals. give them the environment and support they need and trust them
    to get the job done

--> The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face - to -
    face conversation

--> Working software is the primary measure of progress.

--> Agile processes promote sustainable development. the sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain
    a constant pace indefinitely.
	
--> Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility

--> Simplicity -- the art of maximizing the amount of work not done -- is essential

--> The best architectures,requirements, and designs emerge from self - organizing teams.

--> At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly
